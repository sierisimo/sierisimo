### Hey there! :penguin:

Welp... this is awkward... I did not know what to put here :monkey: so... here's some Kotlin

```kotlin
val sierisimo = GitHubUser(
   name = "Sier",
   handle = GitHubHandle("Sierisimo"), // 🤯
   otherHandles = everywhereAs("@sierisimo"),
   location = Locations.Mexico, // 🇲🇽
   expertise = listOf(Tech.ANDROID, Tech.GRADLE),
   langs = listOf(Lang.Kotlin, Lang.Java),
   intereted = listOf(Lang.Haskell, Lang.Rust)
)
``` 

<!--
